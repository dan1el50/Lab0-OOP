In the distant land of Everlight, nestled between towering mountains and endless valleys, the people lived in harmony
with nature. Every morning, the sun would rise over the Emerald Ridge, casting golden hues across the Misty Lake.
Tales were told of ancient spirits that guarded the land, hidden in the whispers of the trees and the songs of the
rivers. The townsfolk celebrated each season with grand festivals, where laughter echoed through the village, and every
soul, young and old, danced under starlit skies. But beneath the peaceful facade lay mysteries yet to be uncovered,
waiting for a curious soul to seek them out and reveal secrets forgotten by time itself.
