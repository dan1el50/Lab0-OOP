In the heart of the city lies an old quarter, untouched by time, where cobblestone streets wind between buildings
steeped in history. The walls are adorned with faded murals and signs from a bygone era, and wrought-iron balconies
overlook the bustling streets below. The air is filled with the aroma of freshly baked bread, mingling with the distant
sounds of street musicians. Every corner reveals a hidden gem—a quiet bookstore, an artisan's workshop,
a café where generations have sipped coffee and shared stories. In the evening, as lanterns flicker to life,
the streets seem to breathe, coming alive with the whispers of those who walked them long ago.
To wander here is to step back in time, where every shadow and every stone holds a piece of the past.
